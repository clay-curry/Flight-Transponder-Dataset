# Reader beware, only God and I knew my thinking at the time of writing much of this.
# Now, only God knows. Failure points are numerous, but overall, it mostly works.

# I dedicate all this code, all my work, to my future husband, Chase, who will
# have to support me and our children and the cats is this code ever gets
# released into the public
