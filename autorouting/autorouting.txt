Transform features into human explainations
 - need to generate a set of encodings from features to "explainations"
    - inclement weather avoidance (need weather data for labeled training data)
    - collision avoidance 
        - predicted storm avoidance
    - attention mechanisms, feature attribution, fuzzy hierarchies provide information for human abstraction
 
 - vehicle classification on the basis of kinematic data
    - attention mechanisms provide information for human abstraction
        -> AMs feed to a NLP
    - novelty detection should be communicated with human operator
