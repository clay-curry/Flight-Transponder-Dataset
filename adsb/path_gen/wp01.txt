#Configuration and path waypoint data file, December, 2021.
#Following is a single line of numeric values for configuration of the
#path generation system. The fields are as follows:
#1) max_sec defining time length in seconds or path type as follows:
#   positive integer-> create path for this number of seconds, stop at last wp.
#   0 -> Stop path creation at end of waypoint list, ignoring the end action.
#   -1-> Ignore end action, instead loop path from end wp back to starting wp.
#   -2-> Continue through the defined end action, if one exists.
#   -3-> Continue through end action and reconnect path to last waypoint.
#   -4-> Continue as in -3 but follow waypoints back to starting wp.
#   -5-> Complete end action then go straight to the starting waypoint.
#   any other negative value will be treated as 0.
#2) sec_step a positive integer value representing the step size in seconds
#   between generated positions.
#3) sec_mission_start a positive integer representing how much time should
#   elapse between the first waypoint and the start of location generation.
#4) var_time A small positive integer used to randomly space the generation of
#   location data. This value will be randomly generated (-/+var_time) before
#   each new location and added to sec_step. Negative values will be changed to
#   1. Set to 0 for no deviation in time between location/message generation. 
#The following 3 values represent perturbations to generated values just before
#they are written to file and should be small floats, such as 0.05.
#These will represent noise added to the actual data, not a change in the data
#itself (see next section for that).
#Thus, these will not cause a change in the actual path generated!
#5) noise_alt float representing the random noise to the altitude values.
#   This value will be *50 then + or - to the actual altitude.
#6) noise_vel float value adjustment as noise to velocity but *100 then + or -.
#7) noise_dir float adjustment as noise to direction (in radians), /2 then +/-.
#The following values represent perturbations to the actual, generated values
#and should be small floats, such as 0.05. These will represent actual
#additions to the data, thus changing the next generated path point.
#8)  var_alt float representing the random amount the altitude will be adjusted.
#    This value will be *50 then + or - to the actual altitude.
#9)  var_vel float value adjustment for velocity but *100 then + or -.
#10) var_dir float adjustment for direction (in radians), /2 then +/-.
